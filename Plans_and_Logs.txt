## Plans
- Idea generation
- Detect Trash
- Annotate images with $10 notes.
  Train model with these images
  (as a proof of concept)
- Discussion with mentor
- Using Taco Dataset for litter
  detection

## Activity logs
- Added ReadME and .gitignore
- Idea generation 
  (only include those more fitting 
   to the theme of helping AISG):
  - litter detector
    - using some existing classes in peekingduck,
  	relabelling as litter class
      (but this would be trivial)
  - adding "currency notes" class to peeking duck model
    for detection.
- Yong Quan annotated images for $10 notes
  - used labelImg
  - took video of a $10 note
  - take 50 frames from the video
  - crop the $10 note out
- Tried opening model in .pb format, failed...
- Idea for dollar note & using peekingduck model scraped 
- Proceed to use annotated TACO dataset for
  training of model for litter prediction
